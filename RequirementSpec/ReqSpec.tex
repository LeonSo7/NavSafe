\section{Project Domain}
\subsection{Purpose and Objective of the Project}
The purpose of NavSafe is to help drivers and pedestrians travel from one destination to the next in the shortest and safest route evaluated based on past collision data. 

\subsection{General Description}
NavSafe is a mobile application brings a new, innovative navigation system which focuses on safety. Vehicle collisions are major concern, especially those which result in injury or death. There are many high-risk intersections which collisions are more likely to occur due to the design of the intersection, as well as other factors out of the travelerâ€™s control. This application allows both drivers and pedestrians, such as foot-pedestrians and bicyclists, to travel safer through mapping a navigation route which reduces the likelihood of collisions based on past collision data obtained from Seattle GIS Open Data. The application also considers specific travelling conditions such as weather, road, and daylight conditions to assign a specific weight to a route for a specific time and location.

\subsection{Stakeholders}

    \subsubsection{The Client}
    The clients of NavSafe consist of the Professor, Dr. R. Samavi, and the teaching assistants of SFWRENG 2XB3.
    
    \subsubsection{The Users}
    The targeted users of NavSafe consist of drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians who seek a safer way to navigate from one destination to another.
    
    \subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
    The other stakeholders this application will impact are the general population of the area where this app is used.

\section{Functional Requirements}
\subsection{Read Module}
The read module is designed to take in the data-set (csv file) and parse the data into a usable form. This is done by reading in the file, one line at a time, and using the data to create a collision object. The object is then stored in an array.

\subsection{Collision ADT Module}
The collisions ADT module is responsible for providing a data structure for which the rest the program will use to perform its various tasks. The data structure represents a collision.

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
\subsection{Reliability}
The program should always return the safest path from the start location to the destination (within the city of Seattle, Washington). Safety of a path is determined by the collision data which is comprised of the collision history for Seattle, Washington.

\subsection{Accuracy of Results}
The program's results should be high in accuracy. The outputted result will be a path. This path must be following roads and should not take the user through places where a vehicle cannot go (both legally and physically). The path should also have the least amount of collisions possible.

\subsection{Performance}
The performance of the program must be relatively quick. Typically when the user will use this program, they will be ready to leave and will want to know the way immediately. For this reason the program should be fast and responsive.

\subsection{Human-computer Interface Issues}
The interface needs to be simple and easy to understand. As mentioned in the Performance section above, users will typically be using this program when they are ready to leave. This implies a sense of urgency and the user will need to be able to use the program in a quick manner. Having a simple user interface will enable faster operations and a smaller learning curve. Also, with the large target user based, people who drive in Seattle, a simple and easy to understand user interface will encourage more people to use the program.

\subsection{Constraints}
    \subsubsection{Operating Constraints}
    The program will be made with the Java SE Development Kit 11 in Android Studio and exported as an apk to be installed and run on an Android device. The program will need to run on Android 4.0 or newer (recommended os support from Google).
    
    \subsubsection{Physical Constraints}
    The program will need to be able to run on an Android smartphone.

\subsection{Quality Control Procedures}
    \subsubsection{Unit Testing}
    Individual units/components of the program will be tested for correctness and reliability. The purpose of this testing to validate that the software is operating as needed to be.
    
    \subsubsection{Continuous Integration Testing}
    Individual modules will be tested for compatibility with existing modules. The purpose of this testing is to prevent incompatible modules from merging into the master branch and causing problems for all members.
    
    \subsubsection{System Testing}
    The completely integrated system will be tested against the specification. The purpose of this test is to verify the program and specification are aligned.
