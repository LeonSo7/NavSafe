%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{NavSafe Objective}
NavSafe seeks to meet the following objective:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Determine the safest route for a person to travel on based on data of collisions in the Seattle area.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Scope}
Features required to accomplish this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fast sorting and searching algorithms
    \item Custom edge-weighted graph (bidirectional)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] Vertices = Intersection
        \item[] Edges = Path between pair of intersections
        \item[] Weight of an edge/vertex based on cumulative severity indices 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Shortest path algorithm (i.e., Dijkstra) to find safest route
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vehicle collisions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Potential risk of \textbf{injury} or \textbf{death}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Many high-risk intersections with flawed designs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Factor out of the travelerâ€™s control
        \item Mistakes by pedestrian or driver has a higher chance of being fatal in these intersections
    \end{itemize}
    \item Areas where flawed design could occur:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Road width
        \item Speed limit
        \item Markings and signs
        \item Intersection infrastructure such as dividers and shoulders
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 5 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dataset(s) Used}
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Collisions" from Seattle GIS Open Data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Number of Collisions
        \item Weather, road, and daylight conditions
        \item Type of collision (pedestrian/vehicle)
        \item Collision details (left/right turn, etc.)
        \item Severity of collision
    \end{itemize}
    \item Intersections dataset from the City of Seattle's data site
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Verification and validation are independent procedures that are used together for checking that a product, service, or system meets requirements and specifications and that it fulfills its intended purpose. 

\frametitle{Verification and Validation}
Quality Control Procedures
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unit Testing
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Verify that individual units of code work as intended
    \end{itemize}
    \item Continuous Integration Testing
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Verify compatibility with existing modules
    \end{itemize}
    \item System Testing
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Verify the program and specification are aligned
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
