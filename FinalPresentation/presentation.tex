%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{NavSafe Objective}
NavSafe seeks to meet the following objective:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Determine the safest route for a person to travel on based on data of collisions in the Seattle area.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Scope}
Features required to accomplish this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fast sorting and searching algorithms
    \item Custom edge-weighted graph (bidirectional)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] Vertices = Intersection
        \item[] Edges = Path between pair of intersections
        \item[] Weight of an edge/vertex based on cumulative severity indices 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Shortest path algorithm (i.e., Dijkstra) to find safest route
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vehicle collisions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They happen.
        \item Potential risk of \textbf{injury} or \textbf{death}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 5 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dataset(s) Used}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collisions dataset from the Seattle GIS Open Data site.
    \item Intersections dataset from the City of Seattle's data site
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 6 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
